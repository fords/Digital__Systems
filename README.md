Fundamentals of computer chips systems


Covers the design of digital systems using hardware description languages. In the second part, it covers the design of large digital systems using the computer design methodology, and culminates with the design of a reduced instruction set central processing unit, associated memory and input/output peripherals. The course further focuses on the design, capture, simulation, and verification of major hardware components such as: the datapath, the control unit, the central processing unit, the system memory, and the I/O modules. The projects enforce and complement the concepts and design principles exposed in the lecture throughthe use of CAD tools and emulation in a commercial FPGA.
